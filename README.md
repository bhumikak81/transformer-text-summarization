## Text Summarization using Transformers
This project implements an abstractive text summarization model using transformer-based architectures from Hugging Face. The model generates concise and meaningful summaries for long pieces of text, making it useful for applications such as news summarization, document shortening, and content generation.

## Features
1. Uses Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., BART, T5, or PEGASUS) for text summarization.
2. Supports abstractive summarization (not just extraction).
3. Handles custom text inputs for generating summaries.
4. Includes training, fine-tuning, and evaluation on summarization datasets.
5. Provides metrics like ROUGE scores for evaluation.
6. Extendable to multiple domains (news, research papers, product reviews).
